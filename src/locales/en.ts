  aboutPageParagraph2: "This project is a work of love, and was born out of the need to be seen on screen - and the saddening realisation of how hard it is to find stories that resonate. The website you are currently accessing was developed using open-source libraries and APIs, including TMDB and OMDB for film data. If you're interested in saying 'thank you', feel free to buy me a coffee via ko-fi :)",
