# LESDB: The Sapphic Film Database

LESDB is a community-driven database dedicated to cataloging sapphic films. Built by and for the sapphic community, our goal is to provide a comprehensive and easily searchable resource for discovering films featuring lesbian and sapphic representation.

## Description

Finding accurate and diverse sapphic representation in film can be challenging. LESDB aims to solve this by creating a centralized platform where users can explore, filter, and discover movies based on various criteria relevant to the sapphic experience. We strive for inclusivity and welcome contributions from everyone who wants to help build this valuable resource.
